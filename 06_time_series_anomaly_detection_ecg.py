"""In this tutorial, you'll learn how to detect anomalies in Time Series data using an LSTM Autoencoder. You're going to use real-world ECG data from a single patient with heart disease to detect abnormal hearbeats.

- [Read the tutorial](https://www.curiousily.com/posts/time-series-anomaly-detection-using-lstm-autoencoder-with-pytorch-in-python/)
- [Run the notebook in your browser (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_J2MrBSvsJfOcVmYAN2-WSp36BtsFZCa)
- [Read the Getting Things Done with Pytorch book](https://github.com/curiousily/Getting-Things-Done-with-Pytorch)

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Prepare a dataset for Anomaly Detection from Time Series Data
- Build an LSTM Autoencoder with PyTorch
- Train and evaluate your model
- Choose a threshold for anomaly detection
- Classify unseen examples as normal or anomaly

## Data



The [dataset](http://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000) contains 5,000 Time Series examples (obtained with ECG) with 140 timesteps. Each sequence corresponds to a single heartbeat from a single patient with congestive heart failure.

> An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a test that checks how your heart is functioning by measuring the electrical activity of the heart. With each heart beat, an electrical impulse (or wave) travels through your heart. This wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart. [Source](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/tests/electrocardiogram)

We have 5 types of hearbeats (classes):

- Normal (N)
- R-on-T Premature Ventricular Contraction (R-on-T PVC)
- Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)
- Supra-ventricular Premature or Ectopic Beat (SP or EB)
- Unclassified Beat (UB).

> Assuming a healthy heart and a typical rate of 70 to 75 beats per minute, each cardiac cycle, or heartbeat, takes about 0.8 seconds to complete the cycle.
Frequency: 60–100 per minute (Humans)
Duration: 0.6–1 second (Humans) [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle)

## LSTM Autoencoder

The [Autoencoder's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) job is to get some input data, pass it through the model, and obtain a reconstruction of the input. The reconstruction should match the input as much as possible. The trick is to use a small number of parameters, so your model learns a compressed representation of the data.

In a sense, Autoencoders try to learn only the most important features (compressed version) of the data. Here, we'll have a look at how to feed Time Series data to an Autoencoder. We'll use a couple of LSTM layers (hence the LSTM Autoencoder) to capture the temporal dependencies of the data.

To classify a sequence as normal or an anomaly, we'll pick a threshold above which a heartbeat is considered abnormal.

### Reconstruction Loss

When training an Autoencoder, the objective is to reconstruct the input as best as possible. This is done by minimizing a loss function (just like in supervised learning). This function is known as *reconstruction loss*. Cross-entropy loss and Mean squared error are common examples.

## Anomaly Detection in ECG Data

We'll use normal heartbeats as training data for our model and record the *reconstruction loss*. But first, we need to prepare the data:

### Data Preprocessing

"""

normal_df = df[df.target == CLASS_NORMAL].drop(labels='target', axis=1)

"""We'll merge all other classes and mark them as anomalies:"""

  random_state=RANDOM_SEED

  val_df,
  test_size=0.33,
  random_state=RANDOM_SEED
)

"""We need to convert our examples into tensors, so we can use them to train our Autoencoder. Let's write a helper function for that:"""

  sequences = df.astype(np.float32).to_numpy().tolist()

  dataset = [torch.tensor(s).unsqueeze(1).float() for s in sequences]

- Choose a threshold for anomaly detection
- Classify unseen examples as normal or anomaly
